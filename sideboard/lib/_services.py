    registered by other plugins.  You call services by attribute lookup, e.g.

    >>> from sideboard.lib import services

    'Hello World!'

    You may get a service which has not yet been registered; you'll only get
    an exception when calling a method on the service if it doesn't exist yet;
    this is to facilitate getting a namespace before the relevant plugin has
    been imported by Sideboard:

    >>> foo, baz = services.foo, services.baz
    >>> foo.bar()
    'Hello World!'
    >>> baz.baf()
    AssertionError: baz is not registered as a service

    Services may be local or websocket, but they're called in the same way.

    use the .jsonrpc attribute of this class, e.g.
